## Project Updates

In this section, we give an overview of notable changes to the projects hosted under the [`rust-osdev`] organization.

[`rust-osdev`]: https://github.com/rust-osdev/about

### [`x86_64`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64)

The `x86_64` crate provides various abstractions for `x86_64` systems, including wrappers for CPU instructions, access to processor-specific registers, and abstraction types for architecture-specific structures such as page tables and descriptor tables.

In September, â€¦

### [`multboot2`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/multiboot2)

The `multiboot2` crate provides abstraction types for the boot information of multiboot2 bootloaders.

It is now part of a workspace and lives next to the new crate `multiboot2-header`.

The following changes were merged this month:

- [Code style improvements + optional CI job (clippy, rustfmt, rustdoc)](https://github.com/rust-osdev/multiboot2/pull/92)
- [editorconfig file](https://github.com/rust-osdev/multiboot2/pull/93)
- [std in tests; hash for TagType](https://github.com/rust-osdev/multiboot2/pull/94) 
- [editorconfig file](https://github.com/rust-osdev/multiboot2/pull/93)
- [prepared cargo workspace, as discussed in PR #79](https://github.com/rust-osdev/multiboot2/pull/86)

The changes were published as <span class="gray">`v0.12.2`</span>.


### [`multboot2-header`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/multiboot2) (**new**)
The `multiboot2-header` crate provides abstraction types for the Multiboot2 header 
and a builder struct to construct these headers. The corresponding repository was 
prepared (<https://github.com/rust-osdev/multiboot2/pull/86>) and the initial release 
is expected in early October. See <https://github.com/rust-osdev/multiboot2/pull/95> for more details.
