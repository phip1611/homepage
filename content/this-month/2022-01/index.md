## Project Updates

In this section, we give an overview of notable changes to the projects hosted under the [`rust-osdev`] organization.

[`rust-osdev`]: https://github.com/rust-osdev/about

### [`x86_64`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64)

The `x86_64` crate provides various abstractions for `x86_64` systems, including wrappers for CPU instructions, access to processor-specific registers, and abstraction types for architecture-specific structures such as page tables and descriptor tables.

In January, â€¦

### [`ntfs`](https://github.com/ColinFinck/ntfs)

<span class="gray">(Section written by [@ColinFinck](https://github.com/ColinFinck))</span>

Colin Finck released an initial version of his [ntfs](https://github.com/ColinFinck/ntfs) crate this month, a Rust library to access Microsoft's proprietary NTFS filesystem.

For those of you who are not running Windows:
NTFS is the primary filesystem in Windows, from Windows NT's release in 1993 up to the current Windows 11.
Unlike FAT32, NTFS has no practical limits for file and partition sizes, comes with B-Tree Indexes for faster lookups, and adds a few resilience and efficiency features (such as journaling, compression, and sparse files). 

The ntfs crate supports Rust's no_std environment and is therefore not tied to a specific platform API.
It aims to be embeddable in firmware-level code and kernels just as well as in user-mode applications.

Colin Finck will [talk about NTFS](https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/misc_ntfs_rust/) and his adventures in writing a filesystem crate in Rust on the upcoming FOSDEM conference.
The talk is on Saturday, 5 February at 17:00 (CET, UTC+1).
The conference is virtual and admission is free.


### [`phip1611/noto-sans-mono-bitmap-rs`](https://github.com/phip1611/noto-sans-mono-bitmap-rs)

<span class="gray">(Section written by [@phip1611](https://github.com/phip1611))</span>

Philipp Schuster released an initial version of his [noto-sans-mono-bitmap](https://github.com/phip1611/noto-sans-mono-bitmap-rs)
crate this month. It is a replacement for legacy bitmap fonts, such as the [font8x8 crate](https://crates.io/crates/font8x8).
It is suited to print high quality/good looking text to a framebuffer in bootloaders, kernels, and similar environments,
where you don't want to use the FPU or you can't.

To avoid CPU intensive soft float workloads, the crate contains pre-rendered symbols from the [Noto Sans Mono font](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+Mono)
in different sizes and font weights (light, regular, bold) as Rust constants paired with a convenient getter function.
Strictly speaking, it encodes each pixel as byte and not bit. However, the term bitmap font is used
because it is known when it comes to fonts without calculation/rasterization overhead in low level environments. 

An example of the outcome can be seen in [PR#213](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/pull/213) of the bootloader crate.
